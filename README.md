# üå¶Ô∏è Simple Texas Weather Forecast with API


## üìå Overview

This is a personal Python project that fetches real-time weather forecasts from the **National Weather Service (NWS)** API. The user can interactively select one of five Texas cities to view the forecast and optionally save it to a local file. The app includes user prompts via pop-ups, input validation, and error handling for a smooth user experience.

  
### üõ†Ô∏è Core Features
  

- üìç Choose from five Texas cities for weather data

- ‚õÖ Fetches forecast data using the ([National Weather Service](https://api.weather.gov/))

- üíæ Saves the forecast to a `.txt` file, handling existing file conflicts gracefully. The default directory is `C:\Users\User\Downloads\`, and you can adjust it to save as you wish.

- üß† Uses core Python concepts: file I/O, regular expressions, exception handling, input validation, functions, and more

- üñ•Ô∏è User-friendly prompts with `pyautogui` popups


## üöÄ Getting Started

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip install requests pyautogui
- Internet connection (to access the weather API)
  
### üì¶ Installation
1.  **Clone this repository:**
```bash
git  clone  https://github.com/your-username/weather-forecast-with-API.git

cd  weather-forecast-with-API
```
  

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Use

1.  **Run the main script:**

```bash
python  main.py
```
  
2.  **Follow on-screen prompts:**  
- Choose a city by typing a number (1‚Äì5)

- Decide whether to view just a sample forecast or more detailed ones

- Choose whether to save the forecast to a file


3.  **File Output Example:**

Forecasts are saved to your `Downloads` folder (C:\Users\User\Downloads\) with the provided file name. If the file already exists, a new one will be created with `_new` appended.

## üß† Concepts Used

This project demonstrates:

- ‚úÖ **Basic Python syntax** (functions, control flow, loops, etc.)

- ‚úÖ **Functions and modularization**

- ‚úÖ **User input validation** and `pyautogui`-based prompts

- ‚úÖ **String manipulation** and formatting

- ‚úÖ **Regular expressions** using `re`

- ‚úÖ **File I/O** using `pathlib` and safe appending

- ‚úÖ **Exception handling** with `try/except`

- ‚úÖ **HTTP requests** using `requests`

- ‚úÖ **Working with JSON APIs**

A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. MOSTLY SUNNY, WITH A HIGH NEAR 97. 
HEAT INDEX VALUES AS HIGH AS 106. SOUTH WIND 0 TO 5 MPH. CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION IS 20%.

Above is just the sample of the nearest forecast, if you want to see more details
You can predict for the next 14 periods
You can type in the number of the period you want to see: type 1 or up to 14 in one integer number
Or you can type in 'yes' to see all of the next forecast period
Or you can type in 'no' to exit the program
Please type in your input: 2

NEW RAINFALL AMOUNTS LESS THAN A TENTH OF AN INCH POSSIBLE.

What is the name of the file you want to save the weather forecast information?
Please type in the name of the file you want to save: weather_forecast_Austin 
The file will be saved in this directory: C:\Users\User\Downloads
The file name will be weather_forecast_Austin.txt
